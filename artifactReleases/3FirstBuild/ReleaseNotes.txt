Release Notes version 3 Final


Goals for this build:

-Fix zombie behaviour of getting stuck on wall do to no path finding
	todo: if(zombie in collision with wall for 2 secounds)
		move zombie along the wall until zombie can enter where player is
-Fix techiniqual depth witch Zombie Spawner, currently 3 zombie spawners exists when i feel as if there should be only one controlling where zombies spawn.

-Fix collision/damage between zombie and barrier, at moment barrier breaks in one hit.
	todo: if solution is unclear go the easy route which is each collision zombie deals damage and gets pushed back for easy collision break
